# full_project_world_layoffs
A repository of SQL data cleaning and EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) projects.

## Introduction
This repository contains projects that can be used to learn Data Cleaning and EDA using SQL

## Problem Statement

In Data Analysis, the analyst must ensure that the data is 'clean' before doing any analysis.  'Dirty' data can lead to unreliable, inaccurate and/or misleading results.  Garbage in = garbage out.

Here are some steps to prepare the data set for analysis
- copy raw data.
- Check for duplicate entries and remove them.
- Remove extra spaces and/or other invalid characters.
- Check for null or empty values.
- Remove null value or blank values.

## Datasets used

The data used is a collection of layoff data from companies around the world. For the data cleaning and EDA process, I using:
- Basic select statements (select, where, group by).
- Aggregate functions (count, sum, min, max)
- Joins
- CTE's, temp tables and views
- string & date manipulation functions.
- Window functions (rank, row_number)
